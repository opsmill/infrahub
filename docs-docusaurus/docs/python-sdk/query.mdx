# Query data from Infrahub

The Python SDK has 3 main methods to query data from Infrahub

- `client.get()`: Query a single object based on some filters
- `client.all()`: Query all objects of a given kind.
- `client.filters()`: Query a list of objects from a given kind based on some filters.

> It's also possible to execute a GraphQL query directly with `client.execute_graphql()`

+++ Async

```python
from infrahub_sdk import InfrahubClient

client = await InfrahubClient.init(address="http://localhost:8000")
accounts = await client.all(kind="CoreAccount")
```

```python
from infrahub_sdk import InfrahubClient

client = await InfrahubClient.init(address="http://localhost:8000")
accounts = await client.get(kind="CoreAccount", id="XXX")
```

```python
from infrahub_sdk import InfrahubClient

client = await InfrahubClient.init(address="http://localhost:8000")
accounts = await client.filters(kind="CoreAccount", name__value="admin")
```

+++ Sync

```python
from infrahub_sdk import InfrahubClientSync

client = InfrahubClientSync.init(address="http://localhost:8000")
accounts = client.all(kind="CoreAccount")
```

```python
from infrahub_sdk import InfrahubClientSync

client = InfrahubClientSync.init(address="http://localhost:8000")
accounts = client.get(kind="CoreAccount", id="XXX")
```

```python
from infrahub_sdk import InfrahubClientSync

client = InfrahubClientSync.init(address="http://localhost:8000")
accounts = client.filters(kind="CoreAccount", name__value="admin")
```

All 3 methods will return an `InfrahubNode` object or a list of `InfrahubNode` objects.
All Attributes and Relationships defined in the schema will be automatically built into the object when it's being initialized.

+++ Async

```python
from infrahub_sdk import InfrahubClient

client = await InfrahubClient.init(address="http://localhost:8000")
account = await client.get(kind="CoreRepository", id="XXX")
print(account.name.value)
```

+++ Sync

```python
from infrahub_sdk import InfrahubClientSync

client = InfrahubClientSync.init(address="http://localhost:8000")
account = client.get(kind="CoreRepository", id="XXX")
print(account.name.value)
```

## Control what will be queried

For all 3 methods you must provide the `kind` of the objects you want to query and based on the schema the SDK will automatically generate the right GraphQL query.

By default the query will include, the attributes, the relationships of cardinality one and the relationships of kind `Attribute`.

it's possible to add or remove some attributes and/or relationships from the query with `include` and `exclude`

+++ Async

```python
from infrahub_sdk import InfrahubClient

client = await InfrahubClient.init(address="http://localhost:8000")
accounts = await client.all(kind="CoreRepository", exclude=["tags"], include=["queries"])
```

+++ Sync

```python
from infrahub_sdk import InfrahubClientSync

client = InfrahubClientSync.init(address="http://localhost:8000")
accounts = client.all(kind="CoreRepository", exclude=["tags"], include=["queries"])
```

+++

## Managing relationships

There are situations to consider while managing relationships via the SDK, depending if the relationship was included in the query or not.

Relationships that are included in a query will be automatically `initialized` which means the ID, type and display name of the peers will be included in the query.

In both cases, you can `fetch()` all the peers of a relationship

+++ Async

```python
from infrahub_sdk import InfrahubClient, InfrahubNode

client = await InfrahubClient.init(address="http://localhost:8000")
account: InfrahubNode = await client.get(kind="CoreRepository", id="XXXX")
await account.tags.fetch()
tags: List[InfrahubNode]  = [ tag.peer for tag in account.tags ]
```

+++ Sync

```python
from infrahub_sdk import InfrahubClientSync, InfrahubNodeSync

client = InfrahubClientSync.init(address="http://localhost:8000")
account: InfrahubNodeSync = client.get(kind="CoreRepository", id="XXXX")
account.tags.fetch()
tags: List[InfrahubNodeSync] = [ tag.peer for tag in account.tags ]
```
