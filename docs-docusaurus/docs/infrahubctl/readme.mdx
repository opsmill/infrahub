# infrahubctl

`infrahubctl` is a command line utility designed to help with the day to day management of an Infrahub installation.
It's meant to run on any laptop or server and it communicates with a remote Infrahub server over the network.

`infrahubctl` can help you to:

- Manage the branches in Infrahub: List, Create, Merge, Rebase, Delete.
- Manage the schema and load new schema files into Infrahub.
- Execute any Python script that requires access to the Python SDK.
- Render a Jinja Template locally for troubleshooting.
- Execute a GraphQL query store in a Git repository for troubleshooting.
- Validate that input files conform with the format expected by Infrahub.

## Configuration

`infrahubctl` requires a minimum configuration in order to connect to the right Infrahub server with the correct credentials. These settings can be provided either in a configuration file, `infrahubctl.toml`, or via environment variables.

### Environment variables

| Name                      | Example value                          |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `INFRAHUB_ADDRESS`        | http://localhost:8000                  |
| `INFRAHUB_API_TOKEN`      | `06438eb2-8019-4776-878c-0941b1f1d1ec` |
| `INFRAHUB_DEFAULT_BRANCH` | main                                   |

> You can also provide the location of a configuration file via the environment variable `INFRAHUBCTL_CONFIG`.
