# Artifact

An artifact is the result of a [Transformation](./transformation.mdx) for a specific context and/or object. It can be either plain text or JSON format.

!!!success Examples

- For a network device, you can use an artifact to track the configuration generated from a Jinja template (Transformation).
- For a Security Device, an artifact can be the list of rules in JSON in the format of your choice generated by a Python Transformation.
- An artifact can also represent the configuration of a DNS server or the configuration of a specific Virtual IP on a load balancer.

While it's always possible to generate [Transformations](./transformation.mdx) on demand via the API, having an Artifact provide some additional benefits:

- **Caching**: Generated artifacts are stored in the internal [object storage](./object-storage.mdx). For resource intensive transformations, it will significantly reduce the load of the system if an artifact can be serve from the cache instead of regenerating each time.
- **Traceability**: Past values of an artifact remain available. In a future release, it will be possible to compare the value of an artifact over time.
- **Peer Review**: Artifacts are automatically part of the [Proposed Change](./proposed-change.mdx) review process.
- **Database**: Artifact nodes are stored in the database and other nodes can optionally have a relationship with them, which makes it possible to perform certain artifact related queries.

While the content of an artifact can change, its identifier will remain the same over time.

## High level design

Artifacts are defined by grouping a [transformation](./transformation.mdx) with a group of targets in an *Artifact Definition*.

An **artifact definition** centralizes all the information required to generate an artifact.

- Group of targets
- Transformation
- Format of the output
- Information to extract from each target that must be passed to the transformation.

From an **artifact definition** artifact nodes are created, for each target which is part of the group. The result of the transformation is stored in the [object storage](./object-storage.mdx). The generation of the artifacts is performed by the git agent(s).

## CoreArtifactTarget

Optionally, a Node can have a relation to an Artifact. The relation will be created when the Artifact is generated the first time. This has the benefit that querying the artifacts for a node becomes easier and that an extra artifacts tab will appear in the Node's detailed view in the UI.

To achieve this we have to inherit from the **CoreArtifactTarget** Generic in the [schema](./schema.mdx) of the node.

```yaml
nodes:
  - name: "Device"
    namespace: "Infra"
    inherit_from: ["CoreArtifactTarget"]
```
