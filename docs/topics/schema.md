# Schema

In Infrahub, the schema is at the center of most things and our goal is to provide as much flexibility as possible to allow users to extend and customize the schema.

Out of the box, Infrahub doesn't have a schema for most things and it's up to users to load a schema that fits their needs. Over time we plan to maintain different schemas for the common types of use cases, but for now, we are providing one example schema to model a basic network with objects like Device, Interface, IPAddress, etc.

Unlike traditional databases that can only have one schema at a time, in Infrahub it is possible to have a different schema per branch. This is possible because the schema itself is stored in the database like any other object.

There is several way to [load a new schema](/guides/schema)

!!!info
In the Tech Preview not all features of the schema are available yet. There are still some important changes coming like support for schema migration and schema dependencies.

## Namespace, Node, Attributes, Relationships & Generics

The schema is composed of 4 primary types of objects: `Nodes`- that are themselves composed of `Attributes` and `Relationships` and finally `Generics`.

- A `Node` in Infrahub represents a `Model`.
- An `Attribute` represents a direct value associated with a `Node` like a `Text`, a `Number` etc ...
- A `Relationship` represents a link between 2 `Node`, a `Relationship` can be of cardinality `one` or `many`.
- A `Generic` can be used to share some attributes between multiple `Node`, if you're familiar with programming concept, it's close to class inheritance.

In the example below, the node `Person` has 2 attributes (`name` and `description`) and the node `Car` has 1 attribute (`model`) and 1 relationship to `Person`, identified by `owner``.

```yaml
nodes:
  - name: Person
    namespace: Example1
    attributes:
      - name: name
        kind: Text
        unique: true
      - name: description
        kind: Text
        optional: true
  - name: Car
    namespace: Example1
    attributes:
      - name: model
        kind: Text
    relationships:
      - name: owner
        peer: Example1Person
        optional: false
        cardinality: one
        kind: Attribute
```

`Node`, `Attribute`, and `Relationship` are defined by their `kind`. While the name and the namespace of the node are up to the creator of the schema, the kinds for the attributes and the relationships are coming from Infrahub. The `kind` of an attribute, or a relationship, is important because it defines how each element is represented in GraphQL and the UI.

> The `kind` of a model is generated by concatenating the `namespace` and the `name`.

### Attribute kinds

- `Text`: Standard Text
- `Number`: Standard Number
- `TextArea`: Long-form Text that can span multiple lines
- `Boolean`: Flag that can be either True or False
- `DateTime`: A Data and a Time
- `Email`: Email address
- `Password`: A Text String that should be obfuscated
- `URL`: An URL to a website or a resource over HTTP
- `File`: Path to a file on the filesystem
- `MacAddress`: Mac Address following the format (XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX)
- `Color`: An HTML color
- `Bandwidth`: Bandwidth in kbps
- `IPHost`: IP Address in either IPV4 or IPv6 format
- `IPNetwork`: IP Network in either IPV4 or IPv6 format
- `Checkbox`: Duplicate of `Boolean`
- `List`: List of any value
- `JSON`: Any data structure compatible with JSON
- `Any`: Can be anything

### Relationship kinds

- `Generic`: Default relationship without specific significance
- `Attribute`: Relationship of type Attribute are represented in the detailed view and the list view
- `Component`: Indicate a relationship with another node that is a component of the current node. Example: Interface is a component to a Device
- `Parent`: Indicate a relationship with another node that is a parent to the current node. Example: Device is a parent to an Interface
- `Group`: Indicate a relationship to a member or a subscriber of a group

## Generics

A generic can be used to:

- Share multiple attributes or relationships between different types of nodes.
- Connect multiple types of Node to the same relationship.
- Define Attribute and Relationship on a specific list of nodes and avoid creating attributes for everything

In the example below, we took the schema that we used previously and refactored it using a generic
Now `Car` is a generic with 2 attributes and 1 relationship and 2 models. `ElectricCar` and `GazCar` are referencing it.
In the GraphQL schema, `ElectricCar` and `GazCar` will have all the attributes and the relationships of `Car` in addition to the one defined under their respective section.

```yaml
generics:
  - name: Car
    namespace: Example1
    attributes:
      - kind: Text
        name: name
        unique: true
      - name: color
        kind: Colo
    relationships:
      - cardinality: one
        identifier: person__car
        name: owner
        optional: false
        peer: Example1Person
nodes:
  - name: ElectricCar
    namespace: Example1
    attributes:
      - kind: Number
        name: nbr_engine
    inherit_from: [ Example1Car ]
  - name: GazCar
    namespace: Example1
    attributes:
      - kind: Number
        name: mpg
    inherit_from: [ Example1Car ]
  - name: Person
    namespace: Example1
    attributes:
      - kind: Text
        name: name
        unique: true
      - kind: Number
        name: height
        optional: true
    relationships:
      - cardinality: many
        identifier: person__car
        name: cars
        peer: Example1Car

```

## Branch support

By default, all models defined in the schema will be **branch-aware** which means that any changes to an object based on a **branch-aware** model will be local to the branch and will not affect the other branches.

A model can also be configured as:

- **branch agnostic**: All changes to an object based on a **branch agnostic** model will automatically be available in all branches.
- **branch local**:  All changes will stay local to the branch. A model in **branch local** mode will not be affected by the Diff and the Merge.

### Summary

{ class="compact" }
| Branch Support | Description                                                                          | Diff | Merge | Rebase |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---- | ----- | ------ |
| **Aware**      | All changes will be local to the branch and can be merged back into the main branch. | Yes  | Yes   | Yes    |
| **Agnostic**   | All changes will automatically be available in all branches                          | No   | No    | No     |
| **Local**      | All changes will be local to the branch and will not be merged to other branches.    | No   | No    | Yes    |

### Branch agnostic

In the frontend, the API, or the GraphQL endpoint **branch-agnostic** objects can be modified on any branchâ€”no restrictions apply.

To configure a model as **branch-agnostic** you need to set the option `branch` to `agnostic` in the schema

```yaml
nodes:
  - name: Fruit
    namespace: Example
    branch: "agnostic"   # <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
    attributes:
      - kind: Text
        name: name
```

### Attributes and relationships

Attributes and relationships can be configured as **branch-aware**, **branch-agnostic**, or **branch-local** too, independently of the configuration of the model itself using the parameter `branch`.

```yaml
nodes:
  - name: Fruit
    namespace: Example
    branch: True # (Default)
    attributes:
      - kind: Text
        name: name
        branch: "agnostic"  # <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
```

By default, if a specific value is not defined:

- **attributes** will inherit the configuration of their parent model.
- **relationships** will become:
  - **branch-agnostic** only if both models on each end of the relationship are **branch-agnostic**. If either model is **branch-aware** the relationship will be set as **branch-aware**.
  - **branch-local** if either model, on each end of the relationship, is **branch-local**.

## Menu

The position of a model in the frontend sidebar menu, is controlled by the schema itself.
At the node (or generic) level, 3 attributes are available to control where a given model should be displayed in the menu and what icon it should have.

### include_in_menu & menu_placement

`include_in_menu` is a Boolean to indicate if a given model should be displayed in the menu or not. By default, all models will be displayed directly under `Objects` in the frontend.

`menu_placement` makes it possible to create a nested structure within the menu to display a given model under another one.

### icon

`icon` can be used to indicate which icon should be displayed next to the model in the menu.
Any icon from the [Material Design Icons library / iconify.design](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/mdi/) can be used.

The full identifier of the icon must be used. Example `mdi:domain`
