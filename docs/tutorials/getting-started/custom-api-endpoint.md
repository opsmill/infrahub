# Create a custom API endpoint

As powerful as Jinja templates are, sometimes itâ€™s both cleaner and simpler to work directly in code. The Infrahub transform endpoint lets you do exactly that. Where an `RFile` combines a GraphQL query together with a Jinja template, the Transform operation combines a GraphQL query with code. You might use a Transform instead of an `RFile` when you need to return structured data as opposed to a classic text-based configuration file.

In the example repository `infrahub-demo-edge` we use a Transform to render a configuration in the Openconfig format. In this example, we want to generate Openconfig interface data. The URL to target looks like this:

```txt
http://localhost:8000/api/transform/openconfig/interfaces?device=ord1-edge1&branch=cr1234
```

Breaking it down into components gives us:

- `http://localhost:8000/api/transform`: The base URL of Infrahub together with the transform endpoint.
- `openconfig/interfaces`: The name of the transform together with the path within that transform. A transform can have multiple internal endpoints, the demo repo allows for `interfaces` and `network-instances/network-instance/protocols/protocol/bgp/neighbors` under the base `openconfig` endpoint.
- `?device=ord1-edge1&branch=cr1234`: The query string that provides a list of arguments for the GraphQL query. In this case only the name of the device. Together with `branch` to show that we want to run the transform against a specific branch within Infrahub.

Render the data by going to this URL (linked from the above example URL): [Generate the Openconfig interface data for `ord1-edge1` on the branch `cr1234`](http://localhost:8000/api/transform/openconfig/interfaces?device=ord1-edge1&branch=cr1234)
