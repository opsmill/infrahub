# Creating a new Sync instance

This guide will walk you through the steps to create a new Sync Instance for Infrahub Sync, allowing you to synchronize data between your source and destination systems efficiently.

## Step 1: Define your configuration

Start by defining your synchronization requirements in a YAML configuration file.

Here's an example configuration for syncing data from Nautobot to Infrahub:
In this example, consider that `device_type` and  `manufacturer` are Attribute of InfraDevice. If you are using another object with a Relationship, you would need to first import those objects and then referenced them (like InfraDevice in InfraInterface)

```yaml
---
name: example-sync-task

source:
  name: nautobot
  settings:
    url: "https://nautobot.example.com"
    token: "NAUTOBOT_API_TOKEN" # This can also be loaded from environment variables

destination:
  name: toto
  settings:
    url: "https://toto.example.com"
    token: "TOTO_API_TOKEN" # This can also be loaded from environment variables


order:
  - "InfraDevice"
  - "InfraInterface"

schema_mapping:
  - name: InfraDevice
    mapping: "dcim.devices"
    identifiers: ["name"]
    fields:
      - name: "name"
        mapping: "name"
      - name: "device_type"
        mapping: "device_type.display_name"
      - name: "manufacturer"
        mapping: "device_type.manufacturer.name"

  - name: InfraInterface
    mapping: "dcim.interfaces"
    identifiers: ["device", "name"]
    fields:
      - name: "name"
        mapping: "name"
      - name: "interface_type"
        static: "10gbe"
      - name: "description"
        mapping: "description"
      - name: "device"
        reference: "InfraDevice"
```
