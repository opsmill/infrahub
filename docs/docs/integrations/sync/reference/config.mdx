# Sync instance configuration file

The configuration file allows you to define the ressources needs for the sync.
The file should be formatted as a Yaml file, have the filename `config.yml`. During the generation phase, the Sync adapters, and models will be generated in the same folder.

The following settings can be defined:

## Configuration fields

Describes the overall synchronization    configuration.

| Property | Type | Description | Mandatory |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- | --------- |
| name | string | Unique identifier for the sync instance. | Yes |
| store | SyncStore | Configuration for the optional storage mechanism. | No |
| source | SyncAdapter | Configuration for the source adapter. | Yes |
| destination | SyncAdapter | Configuration for the destination adapter. | Yes |
| order | List of strings | Specifies the order in which objects should be synchronized. | Yes |
| schema_mapping | List of SchemaMappingModel | Defines how data is mapped from source to destination. | Yes |

### Sync store

Optional configuration for a storage mechanism used for stateful synchronization.

| Property | Type | Description | Mandatory |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- | --------- |
| type | string | Type of the store (for example    `redis`). | Yes |
| settings | Dictionary | Connection details and other settings for the store. | No |

<!-- vale off -->
### Source and Destination
<!-- vale on -->
Configuration for source and destination adapters.

| Property | Type | Description | Mandatory |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- | --------- |
| name | string | Identifier for the adapter. | Yes |
| settings | Dictionary | Adapter-specific settings like `url` and `token`. If not provided, values will be loaded from environment variables. | No |
<!-- vale off -->
### Schema Mapping
<!-- vale on -->
Defines the mappings from source to destination schemas.

#### Mapping models

| Property | Type | Description | Mandatory |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- | --------- |
| name | string | Infrahub model name to be mapped. | Yes |
| mapping | string | The source's schema mapping (API) path. | Yes |
| identifiers | List of strings | Fields used to uniquely identify an object. | Yes |
| fields | List of SchemaMappingField | Describes individual field mappings or transformations. | Yes |
| filters | List of SchemaMappingFilter | Filters you want to apply during the sync. | No |
| transforms | List of SchemaMappingTransform | Transforms you want to apply during the sync. | No |

##### Mapping field

| Property | Type | Description | Mandatory |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- | --------- |
| name | string | Name of the field. | Yes |
| mapping | string | How the field is mapped from source to destination. | No |
| static | Any | A static value to assign to the field, used if `mapping` is not provided. | No |
| reference | string | Reference to another object in the configuration, used if direct mapping is not applicable. | No |

##### Mapping filters

| Property | Type | Description | Mandatory |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- | --------- |
| field | string | Name of the source field to filter on. | Yes |
| operation | string | Which filters will be applied on the field. Available operations are described below. | No |
| value | string | The expected value linked to the operation. | Yes except for both is_empty and is_not_empty operation |

###### Available filter operations

| Operation | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `==` | Checks if the field value is equal to the provided value. |
| `!=` | Checks if the field value is not equal to the provided value. |
| `>` | Checks if the field value is greater than the provided value (after converting both to integers if necessary). |
| `<` | Checks if the field value is less than the provided value (after converting both to integers if necessary). |
| `>=` | Checks if the field value is greater than or equal to the provided value (after converting both to integers if necessary). |
| `<=` | Checks if the field value is less than or equal to the provided value (after converting both to integers if necessary). |
| `in` | Checks if the field value is within the provided list or string. |
| `not in` | Checks if the field value is not within the provided list or string. |
| `contains` | Checks if the provided value is contained within the field value. |
| `not contains` | Checks if the provided value is not contained within the field value. |
| `is_empty` | Checks if the field value is `None` or empty. Does not require a `value` argument. |
| `is_not_empty` | Checks if the field value is not `None` and not empty. Does not require a `value` argument. |
| `regex` | Checks if the field value matches the provided regular expression pattern. |
| `is_ip_within` | Checks if the field value (an IP address) is within the provided IP range using `netutils`. |

##### Mapping transforms

| Property | Type | Description | Mandatory |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- | --------- |
| field | string | Name of the target field. | Yes |
| expression | string | A Jinja filter compatible expression. | Yes |
