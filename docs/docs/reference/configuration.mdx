# Configuration file

The Infrahub containers have a number of environmental variables available at runtime to affect their behavior.

## Usage

Here are a few common methods of setting environmental variables:

- Exporting in a shell, example: `export INFRAHUB_ADDRESS="http://localhost:8000"`
- Using a [`.env` file](https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/set-environment-variables/#substitute-with-an-env-file)
- Using [direnv](https://direnv.net/)

:::note

`infrahubctl` has it's own environmental variables. See the [infrahubctl documentation](../infrahubctl#environment-variables) for more information.
