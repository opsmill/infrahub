# Infrahub FAQ

## What is the status of the Infrahub project?

Infrahub is currently in in open beta, which means that not all features we are targeting for the first major release have been implemented yet and the project is still evolving at a very rapid pace. For upcoming development plans, see our [public roadmap](https://opsmill.atlassian.net/jira/discovery/share/views/7e5d4ab1-63d7-405e-b453-ad50cd9d5b71).
