# Release 0.16.0

We are thrilled to announce the latest release of Infrahub (0.16), marking the start of our open beta.
This release focuses on preparing for the open beta by cleaning up and improving documentation and introducing key features like the Resource Manager.

## Main changes

### Multi profiles

#### Frontend update

We can now select multiple profiles when creating and editing an object.

The `profile_priority` value from the profile schema is used to understand which value is used for the fields (the lower the number is, the higher the priority is).

## Breaking Changes

### Migration of the demo instance

If you are using the demo environment, you can migrate to the latest version with the following commands

```shell
invoke demo.stop
invoke demo.build
invoke demo.migrate
invoke demo.start
```

If you don't want to keep your data, you can start a clean instance with the following command

```shell
invoke demo.destroy demo.build demo.start demo.load-infra-schema demo.load-infra-data
```

> All data will be lost, please make sure to backup everything you need before running this command.

The repository https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub-demo-edge has also been updated, it's recommended to pull the latest changes into your fork.
