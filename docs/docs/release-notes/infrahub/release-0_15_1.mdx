# Release 0.15.1

We are thrilled to announce the latest release of Infrahub (0.15.1).

## Main changes

### Unified storage

### Schema

### Frontend

#### Multi profiles

We can now select multiple profiles when creating and editing an object.

The `profile_priority` value from the profile schema is used to understand which value is used for the fields (the lower the number is, the higher the priority is).

#### Generic relationship select fixes

The select for a generic relationship has been fixed to properly reset the value when changing the kind or the parent.

The parent is also not showing "Unknown" after choosing an object.

The parent select is also now hidden if it's not available.

It's displayed and available only of the kind selected can point to an object which we can filter depending on its parent.
