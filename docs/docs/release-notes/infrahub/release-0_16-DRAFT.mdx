## Main changes

### Multi profiles

#### Frontend update

We can now select multiple profiles when creating and editing an object.

The `profile_priority` value from the profile schema is used to understand which value is used for the fields (the lower the number is, the higher the priority is).

### Unified storage

### Schema

### Helm Chart

### Other

## Migration Guide

To migrate your instance of Infrahub to the latest version, please run the following commands and restart all instances of Infrahub.

<!-- vale off -->
```shell
infrahub db migrate
infrahub db update-core-schema

> if you are running in docker these commands need to run from the container where Infrahub is installed

### Migration of the demo instance

If you are using the demo environment, you can migrate to the latest version with the following commands

```shell
