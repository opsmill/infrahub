# Release 0.16.3

We are thrilled to announce the latest release of Infrahub, version *0.16.3*!

This release focuses largely on bug fixes and is driven by our Beta Test users,
and as always we greatly appreciate their feedback and time!

## Main changes

The complete list of changes can always be found in the `CHANGELOG.md` file in the Infrahub Git repository.

### Removed

- Removed `infrahub.toml` configuration file from Docker builds.

### Fixed

- Save a diff in smaller pieces instead of all at once to prevent out-of-memory error. ([#4511](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/4511))
- Fixes exception handling section in the Python SDK batch guide.

## Migration guide

To migrate your instance of Infrahub to the latest version, please run the following commands and restart all instances of Infrahub.

<!-- vale off -->
```shell
infrahub db migrate
infrahub db update-core-schema
```
<!-- vale on -->

> if you are running in docker these commands need to run from the container where Infrahub is installed

### Migration of the demo instance

invoke demo.build
invoke demo.migrate
invoke demo.start
```

```shell
