## Main Changes

### Conflict resolution for proposed changes

When working with a proposed change and there are data conflicts between the source and target branch,
the system now lets you specify how you want to resolve the conflict when merging. I.e. if you want to
keep the data from the source branch of use what's already in the target branch.

### Python SDK

The Python SDK code now lives its own package and has been renamed from infrahub_client -> infrahub_sdk.

### Friendlier error messages within the frontend

The frontend how displays error messages from GraphQL that are easier to understand.

### Change URL schema in the frontend

The namespace of an object is now included in the URL to avoid conflicting URLs between namespaces.

### Added support for loading multiple schema files and the ability to load from a git repository

Previously you had to use the API or infrahubctl to load schema definitions into Infrahub. A third option
is now to specify these files in an external git repository. Multiple files can be specified to avoid working
with very large files for complex schemas.

### Add ability to query nodes based on lineage information

Now you are able to query nodes using lineage information such as owner. So it's possible to query for
all nodes that are owned by a specific account.

### Add support for specifying a UUID of nodes that are being created

Previously the ID of a node was always determined by the system, now it's possible to specify a custom uuid
when creating objects. For example when syncing from another system, it would now be possible to keep uuids
used in that other system.

### Add checks for Artifact on a proposed change

When opening a proposed change the system will run checks for any artifact definitions that are defined
so that it's possible to see how a proposed change might change an artifact and also if the artifact can
be created successfully or if there is an error that should be resolved before merging.

### Add ability to run checks for merge conflicts in Git

When there are repositories tied to a proposed change using non data-only branches the internal CI
system will now check if there are any merge conflicts within the git repositories that needs to be
resolved before merging the proposed change.

### Add the ability to run user defined checks for a proposed change

It's possible to specify user defined checks within an external repository, these can then be executed
as part of a proposed change within the internal CI system.
