# Release 0.16

We are thrilled to announce the latest release of Infrahub, version *0.16*!

This release focuses on adding critical features for additional use cases (for example, the Number resource pool capabilities)
and on enhancing the user experience.

Several user experience enhancements outlined below, such as for the Git Repository or Proposed Change workflows,
are driven by valuable feedback from our early testers.
We greatly appreciate all their time and efforts!

## Main changes

### Object management

#### Number resource pool

Users can now create a Resource pool for Numbers (integers) as well as IP Addresses/Prefixes.

This will enable users to assign items such as AS Number from a pool, and is managed via a Resource Manager the same way that IP Addresses/Prefixes are:

Adding a Number Pool:

!["Example screenshot of configuring a Number Pool in Infrahub."](../../media/release_notes/infrahub_0_16_0/number_pool_detail.png)

See the Resource Manager documentation for more information on managing and utilizing Resource Pools:

- [Tutorials - Resource Manager](/tutorials/getting-started/resource-manager)

### Unified storage

#### Git repository management

The integration with external Git Repositories is very important to Infrahub, and major user experience improvements were implemented in v0.16.

As a user, it is now easier to manage Git repositories and to understand and troubleshoot the situation when things are not working as expected.

Added/changed features include:

- Improvements to identifying the state of the repository
- Additional logging and notifications, for example if authentication to the repository is not working
- Deleting a repository will delete the associated resources
- The supplied Git URL does not need to have the `.git` suffix, Infrahub will automatically handle this

See the documentation for more information on using Git repositories with Infrahub:

- [Guides - Adding/updating external repositories](/guides/repository)
- [Topics - Repository](/topics/repository)

### Schema

### Frontend

#### Branch diff improvements

There were many improvements to how the Proposed Change diff between two branches operates and is displayed.

For example:

- The view of a diff now is displayed as a tree, showing where/how specific objects have been added/deleted/modified.
- The calculated diff between branches is now cached in the database.
- The diff operation itself is considerably faster.

##### Before and after

Diff view in v0.15.3:

!["View of a diff between two branches in Infrahub v0.15.3."](../../media/release_notes/infrahub_0_16_0/diff_view_enhancements_before.png)

Diff view in v0.16.0:

!["View of a diff between two branches in Infrahub v0.16.0."](../../media/release_notes/infrahub_0_16_0/diff_view_enhancements.png)

As you can see above, there is much more information available for in version 0.16.0.

##### Further information

See the documentation for Version Control and Proposed Changes for more information:

- [Topics - Immutability and version control](../../topics/version-control#version-control)
- [Topics - Proposed change](../../topics/proposed-change)

#### Filter internal groups

Infrahub makes extensive use of Groups internally for features such as Generators.

However, these groups can clutter and confuse the Group assignment/editing user experience.

In v0.16.0, these groups are now hidden by default but can be made visible via an `auto-generated` toggle on the Group management screen as shown below:

import HideAutoGeneratedGroups from '../../media/release_notes/infrahub_0_16_0/hide_auto_generated_groups.png';

<img
  src={HideAutoGeneratedGroups}
  alt="Example of the button to hide 'auto-generated' groups."
  style={{width: 500}}
/>
