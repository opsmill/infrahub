## Main Changes

Ability to run checks on a proposed change based on a target group
With this change any check you define in an external Git repository can be tied to a group. This enables you to run the same check across all members of a group. For instance a custom check that gets executed on for all devices.

# Upsert mutations

The upsert mutations allows you to update or create a resource with a single mutation. It can be useful if you are not sure if an object exists and you want to either update or create the object.

## Add new attribute type: Dropdown

The dropdown works in the same way as an enum with the difference that the dropdown also supports assigning a color and description to make them stand out more. The description is visible when choosing the options, and the color will be displayed in the different views.

## Add mutations and ability to add or remove enums and dropdowns as a user

A user can now add or remove enum and dropdown attribute choices using a mutation or the frontend.

## Add new storage options

With the redesigned storage engine it's now possible to store artefacts in AWS S3 (or S3 compatible) aside from the local storage on disk.

## Extend IPHost and IPNetwork types

Instead of just returning the ip interface (i.e., 172.16.1.1/24) or the ip network (i.e., 172.16.1.0/24) Infrahub now exposes additional options aside from value so you can query for ip, prefix_len, netmask etc. This should simplify some tasks when creating Jinja templates or Transforms.

## Add markdown editor for textarea fields

A markdown editor has been added and will be used for all textarea type fields, and for comments in the proposed changes.
