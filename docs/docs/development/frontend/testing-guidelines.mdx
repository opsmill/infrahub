# Running & writing tests for frontend

:::info Before we start

If you have never run Infrahub tests before, we highly suggest following the [frontend guide](getting-set-up).

:::

We're expecting to see proper tests for each feature/bugfix you make. If you're not sure how to write these tests, this page is made to help you get started.

Infrahub frontend has 3 types of testing:

- [end-to-end (e2e) tests](#e2e-tests)
- [integration tests (documentation WIP)](#integration-tests)
- [unit tests (documentation WIP)](#unit-tests)

## E2E tests

Infrahub uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for e2e testing.

### Folder structure

E2E tests are located in `/frontend/tests/e2e`.

### Writing e2e tests

[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/codegen) can automatically generate tests as you perform actions in the browser, making it a quick way to start testing:

```bash
npx playwright codegen
```

To run a specific test, substitute `test` with `test.only`, or use the --grep 'test name' CLI parameter:

```ts
...
test.only('test name', async ({ page }) => {
  expect(response.ok).toBe(true);
});
// or
npx playwright test --grep 'test name'
```

To disable a specific test, substitute `test` with `test.skip`:

```ts
test.skip('test name', async ({ page }) => {
  expect(response.ok).toBe(true);
});
```

### Debugging e2e tests

To debug a test, you need to run tests in debug mode. You can pause script execution using:

```ts
await page.pause();
```

To continue, press 'Resume' button in the page overlay or call `playwright.resume()` in the DevTools console.

At the end of each test, all traces are saved for exploration in `/frontend/playwright-report`. You can open `index.html` in a browser or run `npx playwright show-report`.

You can find a tutorial on how to use Trace viewer GUI [here](https://playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer).

### Best practices

1. Prioritize user-facing attributes and avoid selectors tied to implementation:

```ts
// ❌
page.locator("[href='/objects/CoreOrganization'] > .group")

// ✅
page.getByRole("button", { name: "Save" });
```

2. Structure tests with steps for better readability:

```bash
# headless mode
npm run test:e2e

# non-headless mode (headed)
npm run test:e2e:headed

# Debug mode
npm run test:e2e:debug

# UI mode
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

## Integration tests

```bash
npm run cypress:run:component
```

## Unit tests

```bash
npm run test

# same with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```
