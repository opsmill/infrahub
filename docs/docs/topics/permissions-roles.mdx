# Roles and permissions

Roles and permissions are essential for controlling user access and behavior in **Infrahub**. Within the platform, they **offer exact control** over what users can see, modify, or control.

The permissions system is split into two main types: **Global** and **Object-specific**.  These permissions aid in defining what users are permitted to do on particular system objects or throughout the system.

## Overview

Permissions fall into two categories: **Global** and **Object-specific**, while roles act as **convenient bundles** of permissions. To simplify things further, **Account Groups** let you manage permissions for multiple users at once.

- **GlobalPermissions** gives users system-wide rights to perform specific actions. **[See full list of available global permissions](/reference/permissions.mdx#global-permissions).**
- **ObjectPermissions** are tied to individual objects within Infrahub and control what actions users can take on those objects. **[See full list of available object permissions](/reference/permissions.mdx#object-permissions).**
- **AccountRoles** are groups of permissions you can assign to accounts.
- **AccountGroups** allow you to manage permissions for multiple users all at once.

## Types of permissions

### Global permissions

With a **GlobalPermission**, a user may act on the entire system, not just on particular objects. **A person with the authority to handle accounts, for instance, can do so globally.**
**The action is blocked** if the required permission is not granted.

:::info Example:

Take the `global:manage_accounts:allow_all` permission:

- **Action**: `manage_accounts`
- **Decision**: `Allow`

This gives the user the ability to manage all user accounts.

### Object permissions

**ObjectPermission** specifies actions, that apply to a certain kind of object. Actions like create, update, remove, and view are supported. Depending on the kind of object or branch, object permissions may be granted or refused.

**Key features**:

- **Supports wildcards (`*`)** to apply permissions across multiple object types.
- **Can define different permissions per branch.**
- **Grants or denies actions based on the assigned permission.**

Here are some examples of object permissions and their descriptions:

| Identifier                                    | Object Type   | Action  | Decision    | Description                                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------------|---------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `object:*:*:create:allow_other`               | `*` (all types)| `any`   | `allow_other`| Allows creating any object, but only on non-default branches. |
| `object:*:*:view:allow_all`                   | `*` (all types)| `view`  | `allow_all` | Allows viewing any object, anywhere, across both default and non-default branches. |
| `object:Builtin:Tag:update:Deny`              | `BuiltinTag`   | `update`| `deny`      | Denies the ability to update any object of type BuiltinTag, across all branches. |
| `object:*:Generic:view:allow_all`             | `*Generic`     | `view`  | `allow_all` | Allows viewing all objects that contain 'Generic' in their type (example: LocationGeneric, DeviceGeneric) in all namespaces, across all branches. |

## Future developments

The authorization structure for Infrahub is constantly changing. Here are some exciting upcoming features:

- **Attribute-based permissions**: Grant permissions at the attribute level within objects.
- **Metadata-based permissions**: Use metadata to specify access controls.
- **Group-based permissions**: Deepen the integration of group memberships for permission assignments.

These new features will make Infrahub's permission system even more powerful and flexible in the future.
