title: Hardware requirements
---

The system on which you want to run Infrahub, has to meet the following hardware requirements:

| Level       | CPU Cores | RAM  | Storage / database (Neo4j) |
|-------------|-----------|------|----------------------------|
| Minimum     | 6         | 12GB | SSD and/or >= 5000 IOPS    |
| Recommended | 8         | 16GB | SSD and/or >= 5000 IOPS    |

If you only want to give Infrahub a try, or follow the [getting started tutorial](/tutorials/getting-started/), then you can use [GitHub Codespaces](/guides/installation#github-codespaces) as an alternative.
