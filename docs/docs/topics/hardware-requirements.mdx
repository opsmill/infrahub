title: Hardware requirements
---

The system on which you want to run Infrahub, has to meet the following hardware requirements:

| Level       | CPU Cores | RAM  | Storage / database (Neo4j) |
|-------------|-----------|------|----------------------------|
| Minimum     | 6         | 12GB | SSD and/or >= 5000 IOPS    |
| Recommended | 8         | 16GB | SSD and/or >= 5000 IOPS    |

If you only want to give Infrahub a try, or follow the [getting started tutorial](/tutorials/getting-started/), then you can use [GitHub Codespaces](/guides/installation#github-codespaces) as an alternative.

## Performance benchmark utility

To evaluate the performance of your system, we provide a small utility that will run some performance benchmark of your system's CPU, Memory and disk IOP.

:::note

Even with the right amount of CPU core and memory, there are some other factors that could impact the performance of Infrahub like the speed of your CPU.

:::

The tool can run on any system using docker with the follow command `docker run --pull always registry.opsmill.io/opsmill/bench`

```bash title="❯ docker run --pull always registry.opsmill.io/opsmill/bench"
