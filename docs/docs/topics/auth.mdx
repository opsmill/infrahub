# User management and authentication

Infrahub now supports standard user management and authentication systems.

A user account can have 3 levels of permissions

- `admin`
- `read-write`
- `read-only`

By default, Infrahub will allow anonymous access in read-only. It's possible to disable this via the configuration `main.allow_anonymous_access` or via the environment variable `INFRAHUB_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS_ACCESS`.

## Authentication mechanisms

Infrahub supports two authentication methods

- JWT token: Short life tokens generated on demand from the API.
- API Token: Long life tokens generated ahead of time.

|                    | JWT  | TOKEN |
| ------------------ | ---- | ----- |
| API / GraphQL      | Yes  | Yes   |
| Frontend           | Yes  | No    |
| Python SDK         | Yes  | Yes   |
| infrahubctl        | Yes  | Yes   |
| GraphQL Playground | No   | Yes   |

More information on managing API token can be found in the [managing API tokens guide](/guides/managing-api-tokens).

:::info

While using the API, the authentication token must be provided in the header:

```yaml
X-INFRAHUB-KEY: 06438eb2-8019-4776-878c-0941b1f1d1ec
```

## Authentication backends

Infrahub supports authenticating users in a local user store or by using single sign-on through an external identity provider.

### Local user store

Users can be created in the local user store. Local users can be added to groups, which can have roles assigned to them.

### Single sign-on

Infrahub supports identity providers that support either OAuth2 or OpenID Connect (OIDC).

Multiple identity providers can be enabled simultaneously, for example to support organizations that use different providers for different security domains.

A user that was authenticated using SSO will be created in the local user store of Infrahub and optionally automatically added to groups, which can have roles assigned to them.

For more information on setting up single sign-on can be found in the [configuring single sign-on guide](/guides/sso).
