# User management and authentication

By default, Infrahub will allow anonymous access in read-only mode. It's possible to disable this via the configuration `main.allow_anonymous_access` or via the environment variable `INFRAHUB_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS_ACCESS`.

## Authentication mechanisms

Infrahub supports two authentication methods:

- **JWT Token**: Short-lived tokens generated on demand from the API.
- **API Token**: Long-lived tokens generated ahead of time.

|                    | JWT  | TOKEN |
| ------------------ | ---- | ----- |
| API / GraphQL      | Yes  | Yes   |
| Frontend           | Yes  | No    |
| Python SDK         | Soon | Yes   |
| infrahubctl        | Soon | Yes   |
| GraphQL Playground | No   | Yes   |

More information on managing API tokens can be found in the [Managing API Tokens Guide](/guides/managing-api-tokens).

:::info

While using the API, the authentication token must be provided in the header:

```yaml
X-INFRAHUB-KEY: 06438eb2-8019-4776-878c-0941b1f1d1ec```

## Assigning permissions

Users are allocated permissions through groups and roles.

- **Users** are members of **Groups**.
- **Groups** are related with **Roles**.
- **Roles** are allocated **Permissions** (global or object-specific).

Using roles and groups to manage permissions, **Infrahub offers a scalable way** to control access for numerous users simultaneously. For more detailed information, visit the [role and permissions page](/topics/permissions-roles).

## Default setup

Infrahub comes with a default configuration that contains pre-configured users, groups, and roles to simplify access management from the start. These **default settings** guarantee that key access and admin capabilities are ready to use out of the box.

### Default account

| Accounts  | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Admin** | The default administrative user in Infrahub. This user is part of the **Super Administrators** group, which gives them full system-wide permissions. |

### Default groups

| Group Name             | Description                                                                                              | Assigned Role        |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Infrahub Users**      | Standard users who have general access to Infrahub, with permission to view and interact with resources.  | **General Access**    |
| **Super Administrators**| Administrators with full control over the system. Users in this group have unrestricted access to all features. | **Super Administrator** |

### Default roles
