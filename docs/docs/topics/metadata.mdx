# Data lineage and metadata

## Data lineage

Data lineage includes the data origin, what happens to it, and where it moves over time. Data lineage provides visibility and simplifies tracing errors back to the root cause in a data analytics process.

In Infrahub, data points such as attributes and relationships have data lineage associated with the object, provided via `metadata`. 

## Metadata

One of the core features of Infrahub is that we can define `metadata` on all data points: attributes and relationships.

The current supported metadata are:

- **Source**: Where is the data coming from. (By default, it can be an `Account` or a `Repository`)
- **Owner**: Who is the owner of this data (By default, it be a `Group`, an `Account` or a `Repository`)
- **Is Protected**: Flag to indicate if a value should be protected or not
- **Is Visible**: An attribute that is not visible, won't show up in the frontend but it will remain available via GraphQL

:::info

Currently the list of metadata available is fixed, but in the future it will be possible to define your own list of metadata.

## Protected fields

When a field is marked as protected, all users that aren't listed as the owner won't be able to modify this specific attribute when trying to edit the object. They will still be able to modify the other attributes.

:::info

Note that accounts defined with the role of `admin` can always update protected fields, regardless of `Owner`.
