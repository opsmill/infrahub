# Inheritance between generics and nodes

## Overview of generics and nodes

### Definition of generics

A Generic in the context of our schema is a template that defines a set of common properties and behaviors.
Generics are used to standardize configurations and ensure consistency across different Nodes that inherit from them.
They serve as blueprints from which Nodes can derive attributes and functionality.

### Definition of Nodes

A Node is an instance that inherits properties from a Generic.
Nodes represent specific entities in the schema that leverage the predefined configurations of Generics while allowing for additional customization.
Nodes can have unique attributes but will inherit common properties from their Generics.

## Inheritance mechanism

### Basic inheritance structure

Inheritance allows Nodes to derive properties from Generics.
This ensures that Nodes maintain a consistent set of attributes defined at the Generic level, reducing redundancy and simplifying updates.

### Single generic inheritance

When a Node is derived from a single Generic, it inherits all properties defined in that Generic unless overridden at the Node level.

```yaml
generics:
  - name: GenericDevice
    namespace: Infra
    description: "Generic Device object."
    label: "Device"
    icon: "mdi:server"
    default_filter: name__value
    order_by:
      - name__value
    display_labels:
      - name__value
    attributes:
      - name: name
        kind: Text
        unique: true
        order_weight: 1000
      - name: description
        kind: Text
        optional: true
        order_weight: 1100

nodes:
  - name: Device
    namespace: Infra
    inherit_from:
      - "GenericDevice"
    attributes:
      - name: role
        kind: Dropdown
        optional: true
        choices:
          - name: core
            label: Core Router
            description: Central part of the network.
            color: "#7f7fff"
          - name: edge
            label: Edge Router
            description: "Network boundary with external networks."
            color: "#bf7fbf"
          - name: cpe
            label: Customer Premise Equipment
            description: "Devices located at the customer's premises."
            color: "#bf7f7f"
          - name: spine
            label: Spine Router
            description: "Aggregation router part of a Fabric."
            color: "#aeeeee"
          - name: leaf
            label: Leaf Switch
            description: "Top of Rack part of a Fabric."
            color: "#e6e6fa"
        order_weight: 1400
```

## Multiple generics inheritance

### Complex inheritance structures

When multiple Generics are involved, determining which properties to inherit can be challenging. The implemented solution prioritizes the first Generic listed in the `inherited_from` array.

:::info First generic preference

Properties will be inherited from the first Generic in the `inherited_from` list if not explicitly defined at the Node level.
This approach simplifies conflict resolution.

```yaml
generics:
  - name: GenericDevice
    namespace: Infra
    icon: "mdi:router"
    default_filter: "name__value"
    attributes:
      - name: name
        kind: Text
        unique: true
        order_weight: 1000

  - name: Asset
    namespace: Infra
    icon: "mdi:server"
    attributes:
      - name: asset_tag
        label: Asset Tag
        kind: Text
        unique: true
        order_weight: 1000

nodes:
  - name: Device
    namespace: Infra
    inherit_from:
      - "InfraGenericDevice"
      - "InfraAsset"
```

## Inherited properties

### List of inheritable properties

- **`human_friendly_id`**: A user-friendly identifier for the entity.
- **`display_labels`**: Labels used for display purposes.
- **`default_filter`**: The default filter applied to the entity.
- **`menu_placement`**: Defines where the entity appears in menus.
- **`uniqueness_constraints`**: Constraints ensuring unique values for certain attributes.
- **`icon`**: The icon representing the entity.
- **`order_by`**: The default order in which entities are listed.

:::warning Limitations and Considerations
Inheritance of properties occurs only during the first import. If a Generic's properties are updated after the Node has been created, these updates will not be propagated to the Node. Users must manually update Nodes if they want to reflect changes made to Generics.
