# Extend the schema

Infrahub can be extended by providing your own schema (or models).

## Default schema

The version of Infrahub we currently use for the demo only included a default schema, composed of 25+ models that are either mandatory for Infrahub to function like `Account`, `StandardGroup`, `Repository` or that are very generic like `Tag`.

## Visualize the active schema

You can explore the current schema by visiting the schema page, you can find it in the left menu under the Unified Storage section.

## Extend the schema with some network related models

In order to model a network, we need to extend the current models to capture more information like: `Device`, `Interface`, `IPAddress`, `BGPSession`, `Location`, `Role`, `Status` etc.

A "base" schema with these types of models and more is available in the `models/base` directory

Use the following command to load these new models into Infrahub

```bash
invoke demo.load-infra-schema
```

**Reload the frontend** to see the new menu corresponding to the new models we added to the schema.

## Load some real data into the database

In order to have more meaningful data to explore, we'll use a sample topology of 6 devices as presented below that is leveraging all the new models we added to the schema.

Use the following command to load these new models into Infrahub:

```bash
invoke demo.load-infra-data
