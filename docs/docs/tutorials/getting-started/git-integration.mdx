# Connect a Git repository to Infrahub

One of the three pillars Infrahub is built on is the idea of having **Unified Version Control for Data and Files** at the same time. The data is stored in the Graph Database and the files in Git.

When integrating a Git repository with Infrahub, the Git agent will ensure that both systems stay in sync at any time.

## Fork & Clone the repository for the demo

Create a fork of the repository `https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub-demo-edge`.

:::info

The goal is to have a copy of this repository under your name. This way your demo won't influence others.

:::

Once you have created a fork in GitHub, you'll need a Personal Access Token to authorize Infrahub to access this repository.

[How to create a Personal Access Token in GitHub](/guides/repository#personal-access-token)

:::note

If you already cloned the repository in the past, ensure only the main branch is present in GitHub.
If other branches are present, we recommend deleting them for now.

  1. Select the name of the active branch in the top left corner (usually main)
  2. Select `View All Branches` at the bottom of the popup
  3. Delete all branches but the branch `main`, with the trash icon on the right of the screen

## Integrate the Git repository with Infrahub

Currently the easiest way to add a repository is to use the web interface.

Refer to [Adding a repository guide](/guides/repository).

After adding the `infrahub-demo-edge` repository you will be able to see several new [Transformations](/topics/transformation) and related objects:

- 3 Jinja Rendered File under [Jinja2 Transformation](http://localhost:8000/objects/CoreTransformJinja2/)
- 4 Python Transformation under [Python Transformation](http://localhost:8000/objects/CoreTransformPython)
- 4 [Artifact Definition](http://localhost:8000/objects/CoreArtifactDefinition)
- 7 GraphQL [Queries](/topics/graphql) under [Objects / GraphQL Query](http://localhost:8000/objects/GraphQLQuery/)

:::note Troubleshooting

If you don't seeing additional objects under the transformations or `GraphQL Queries`, it's possible that the `Git agent` might not be running anymore.

In this case, you should run `invoke demo.start` first to ensure that everything is working.
