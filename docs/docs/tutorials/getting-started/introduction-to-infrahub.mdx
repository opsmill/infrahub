# Introduction to Infrahub

Before starting this tutorial, let's take a moment to explore how Infrahub is organized as an application and how we can interact with it.

## Infrahub components

During this tutorial we'll mainly use the Frontend, the `infrahubctl` CLI and the GraphQL API via the API Server.
