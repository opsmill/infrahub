# Infrahub overview

![Infrahub architecture](../media/overview.excalidraw.svg)

Infrahub acts as a central hub to manage all of the information and code that powers your infrastructure. At its heart, Infrahub is built on 3 fundamental pillars:

- **A Flexible Schema**: A model of the infrastructure and the relation between the objects in the model, that's easily extensible.
- **Version Control**: Natively integrated into the graph database which opens up some new capabilities like branching, diffing, and merging data directly in the database.
- **Unified Storage**: By combining a graph database and git, Infrahub stores data and code needed to manage the infrastructure.

This overview will explore the design and components of Infrahub and how the platform interacts with other systems to manage the infrastructure. To do this we'll walk through workflows and explain key concepts. This overview will cover:

- [Ways to interface with Infrahub](./interfaces)
- [Schema purpose and concepts](./schema)
- [Data input and sync](./data)
- [Data Transformations](./transformations.mdx)
- [Version Control, CI and Checks](./versioning.mdx)
- [Generators & Design-Driven Automation](./generators.mdx)
- [External integrations with automation frameworks (Ansible, Nornir)](./integrations.mdx)
