# Infrahub generators

Generators in Infrahub are tools that automatically create infrastructure objects based on predefined templates and user inputs. They serve as a way to streamline the process of setting up complex infrastructure stacks while allowing for customization.

Key aspects of generators include:

1. Template-based: Generators use templates as a starting point for creating infrastructure configurations.

2. User input: They prompt users for specific information needed to customize the generated objects.

3. Automation: Generators automate repetitive tasks in infrastructure setup, reducing manual effort and potential errors.

4. Consistency: By using generators, teams can ensure consistent infrastructure setups across different projects or environments.

5. Customization: While based on templates, generators allow for significant customization to meet specific project requirements.

6. Versioning: InfraHub supports versioning of generator outputs, enabling users to track changes over time.

7. Integration: Generators can be integrated into workflows and CI/CD pipelines for automated infrastructure provisioning.

8. Extensibility: Advanced users can create custom generators to suit their organization's specific needs.

## Design-driven automation

Having a flexible schema opens up new possibilities not previously available. Infrahub allows a business workflow or service to be implemented in the [schema](../topics/schema.mdx) and instantiated by a generator.

Downstream objects are linked to the generator. If a business service needs updating or expansion, all needed changes can be generated to keep the infrastructure consistent and validated.
