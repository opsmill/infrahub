title: Using the object-storage
---

In this guide we will be showing you how you can store and retrieve objects or files in Infrahub's object-storage.
For more information on the object-storage please see the [object-storage topic](/topics/object-storage).

## Uploading a file to the object-storage

To upload a file to the object-storage we can use the `/api/storage/upload/file` REST API endpoint.

Create a file on your system. You can save the file anywhere you want, with any filename you want. But in this guide we will be using `/tmp/test.json`

```json
{
    "key": "value",
    "list": [
        "item1",
        "item2",
        "item3"
    ]
}
```

We will be using the `curl` command to upload the file.

:::note

You might have to change the X-INFRAHUB-KEY header value to the API token of your user, if you are not using the default.

:::

```sh
curl -X POST --header "X-INFRAHUB-KEY: 06438eb2-8019-4776-878c-0941b1f1d1ec" http://localhost:8000/api/storage/upload/file -F file=@/tmp/test.json
```

The response will be a JSON object representing the object in the object-storage. Take note of the identifier.

```json
{"identifier":"17d198df-3102-00e0-3349-c51ae276e246","checksum":"f4516d51f2c894fc47df1782c6661ebc"}
```

## Retrieving the object from the object-storage

To retrieve objects from the object-storage we can use the `/api/storage/object/<identifier>` REST API endpoint.
The identifier in the URL should be the identifier that you gathered from the previous step.

:::note

You might have to change the X-INFRAHUB-KEY header value to the API token of your user, if you are not using the default.

:::

```curl
curl --header "X-INFRAHUB-KEY: 06438eb2-8019-4776-878c-0941b1f1d1ec" http://localhost:8000/api/storage/object/17d198df-3102-00e0-3349-c51ae276e246
{
    "key": "value",
    "list": [
        "item1",
        "item2",
        "item3"
    ]
}
```

## Storing objects in the object-storage

You can upload any string based object into the object-storage, as an alternative to uploading a file.
In this step we will be storing the string "interface Ethernet1\n  description: Connected to Ethernet2" into the object-storage.

:::note

You might have to change the X-INFRAHUB-KEY header value to the API token of your user, if you are not using the default.

:::

```shell
curl -X POST --header "Content-Type: application/json" --header "X-INFRAHUB-KEY: 06438eb2-8019-4776-878c-0941b1f1d1ec" http://localhost:8000/api/storage/upload/content --data '{"content": "interface Ethernet1\n  description: Connected to Ethernet2"}'
```

```json
{"identifier":"17d19962-4420-4972-334d-c51beb03e477","checksum":"843cde3df258ab3027618712952499cd"}
```

Retrieving the object works as described in the previous step.

```shell
curl --header "X-INFRAHUB-KEY: 06438eb2-8019-4776-878c-0941b1f1d1ec" http://localhost:8000/api/storage/object/17d19962-4420-4972-334d-c51beb03e477
```
