# Installing Infrahub

Infrahub is deployed as a container-based architecture, comprised of multiple components. The main components are:

- A **Frontend** written in React.
- An **API server** written in Python with FastAPI.
- A **Git agent** to manage the interaction with external Git repositories.
- A **Graph database** based on `Neo4j`.
- A **Message bus** based on `RabbitMQ`.
- A **Cache** based on `redis`.

Refer to [Architecture](/topics/architecture) for a more in-depth view of the components' interaction.

## Hardware requirements

Please ensure the systems on which you want to install Infrahub meet the [hardware requirements](/topics/hardware-requirements).

## Quick start via curl

To quickly test Infrahub locally:

```bash
curl https://infrahub.opsmill.io | docker compose -f - up -d
```

Alternative examples:

```bash
curl https://infrahub.opsmill.io/develop | docker compose -f - up -d
curl https://infrahub.opsmill.io/0.15.2 | docker compose -f - up -d
```

## From Git repository

Create the base directory for the Infrahub installation. For this guide, we'll use `/opt/infrahub`.

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /opt/infrahub/
cd /opt/infrahub/
```

:::warning

Depending on your system configuration, you might have to give other users write permissions to the `/opt/infrahub` directory.

:::

Usage of the `/opt/infrahub` directory is merely a suggestion. You can use any directory on your system, especially for development or demo purposes.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/source/infrahub/
cd ~/source/infrahub/
```

Next, clone the `stable` branch of the Infrahub GitHub repository into the current directory. (This branch always holds the current stable release)

```bash
git clone -b stable --depth 1 https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub.git
```

:::note

The command above utilizes a "shallow clone" to retrieve only the most recent commit. If you need to download the entire history, omit the --depth 1 argument.

:::

The `git clone` command should generate output similar to the following:

```bash
Cloning into '.'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 1312, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (1312/1312), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (1150/1150), done.
remote: Total 1312 (delta 187), reused 691 (delta 104), pack-reused 0
Receiving objects: 100% (1312/1312), 33.37 MiB | 14.46 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (187/187), done.
```

### Docker Compose

The recommended way to run Infrahub is to use the Docker Compose files included with the project combined with the helper commands defined in `invoke`.

The pre-requisites for this type of deployment are to have:

- [Invoke](https://www.pyinvoke.org) (version 2 minimum)
- [Toml](https://toml.io/en/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (version 24.x minimum)

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="MacOS" default>
#### Invoke

On MacOS, Python is installed by default so you should be able to install `invoke` directly.
Invoke works best when you install it in the main Python environment, but you can also install it in a virtual environment if you prefer. To install `invoke` and `toml`, run the following command:

```bash
pip install invoke toml
```

#### Docker

To install Docker, follow the [official instructions on the Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/) for your platform.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Windows">
On Windows, install a Linux VM via WSL2 and follow the installation guide for Ubuntu.

:::warning

The native support on Windows is currently under investigation and is being tracked in [issue 794](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/794).
Please add a comment to the issue if this is something that would be useful to you.

:::
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Ubuntu">
:::warning

On Ubuntu, depending on which distribution you're running, there is a good chance your version of Docker might be outdated. Please ensure your installation meets the version requirements mentioned below.

:::

#### Invoke

Invoke is a Python package commonly installed by running `pip install invoke toml`.
If Python is not already installed on your system, install it first with `sudo apt install python3-pip`.

#### Docker

Check if Docker is installed and which version is installed with `docker --version`
The version should be at least `24.x`. If the version is `20.x`, it's recommended to upgrade.

[This tutorial (for Ubuntu 22.04) explains how to install the latest version of docker on Ubuntu](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-22-04).
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Other">
The deployment should work on any systems that can run a modern version of Docker and Python.

Please reach out if you need some help and feel free to send a PR with the installation instructions for your platform.

Once docker desktop and invoke are installed you can build, start, and initialize the Infrahub demo environment with the following command:

```bash
invoke demo.build demo.start demo.load-infra-schema demo.load-infra-data
```

<ReferenceLink title="Check the documentation of the demo environment for more information" url="/topics/local-demo-environment" />

### GitHub Codespaces

The Infrahub GitHub repository is designed to launch an instance via [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview). We have two devcontainer configurations:
<!-- vale off -->
- **infrahub:** a deployment running without any [Schema](/tutorials/getting-started/schema) or data pre-installed
- **infrahub-demo:** a deployment running the [demo environment](/topics/local-demo-environment)
<!-- vale on -->
|  No Data | Demo Data |
|---|---|
| [![Launch in GitHub Codespaces (No Data)](https://img.shields.io/badge/Launch%20Infrahub-0B6581?logo=github)](https://codespaces.new/opsmill/infrahub?devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fdevcontainer.json&ref=stable) | [![Launch in GitHub Codespaces (Demo Data)](https://img.shields.io/badge/Infrahub%20with%20Data-0B6581?logo=github)](https://codespaces.new/opsmill/infrahub?devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fdemo-container%2Fdevcontainer.json&ref=stable) |

:::note

The default devcontainer `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` launches Infrahub with no schema or data. If you want to launch a deployment with the demo schema and data, you will need to choose the alternate `Dev container configuration` in the GitHub Codespaces creation options.

## K8s with Helm charts

A first version of our K8S helm-chart is available in our repository.

<ReferenceLink title="Infrahub Helm Chart" url="https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/tree/stable/helm" openInNewTab />

The following are required for production deployments using Helm:

- data persistence must be enabled (except for the Infrahub API Server if using S3 storage)
- multiple replicas of the Infrahub API Server and Infrahub Git Agents should be deployed: you can make use of the `affinity` variable to define the affinity policy for the pods
- a shared storage should be available for use by the Git Agents (through a StorageClass that supports RWX accesses)
- S3 storage should be configured for the Infrahub API Server

You can use the following values example:

```yaml
global:
  infrahubTag: stable
  imagePullPolicy: Always

infrahubServer:
  replicas: 3

    podAntiAffinity:

You can also install the chart using the OpsMill registry.

```bash
helm install infrahub -f values.yml oci://registry.opsmill.io/opsmill/chart/infrahub
```
