# Creating and assigning profiles

In this tutorial we will be creating a Profile for a network device interface, and then create multiple interfaces using that profile.

The profile will be used to create interfaces that will connect end-users. We want all the end-user interfaces in our network to have exactly the same configuration.

The following configuration attributes need to be defined in the profile:

- Profile: end-user-interface
- Status: active
- Enabled: true
- Auto negotiation: enabled
- MTU: 1500 bytes
- Mode: Access
- Untagged VLAN: 10
- Role: end-user

We will be assuming the following schema has been loaded into Infrahub, this is a requirement to be able to complete the rest of this guide.

```yaml

  - name: Interface
    namespace: Infra

        optional: true
        choices:

            label: Drained

            color: "#bfbfbf"
      - name: role
        kind: Dropdown
        optional: true
        choices:
          - name: uplink
            label: Uplink

            color: "#9090de"
          - name: end_user
            label: End user
            description: "Interface to connect end-user devices"
            color: "#ffa07a"
          - name: server
            label: Server
            description: "Interfaces to connect to servers"
            color: "#98b2d1"
```

From this schema Infrahub will generate a `ProfileInfraInterface` schema. Infrahub will also generate a GraphQL query `ProfileInfraInterface` and the GraphQL mutations `ProfileInfraInterfaceCreate`, `ProfileInfraInterfaceDelete`, `ProfileInfraInterfaceUpdate` and `ProfileInfraInterfaceUpsert`.

Profiles, at this stage, can be only be used from the GraphQL API or the Python SDK. In a future release we will add support for managing profiles using the web frontend.

## Creating the profile

We can create the profile by executing the following GraphQL mutation:

```graphql
mutation {
  ProfileInfraInterfaceCreate(
    data: {
      profile_name: {value: "end-user-interface"},
      status: {value: "active"},
      enabled: {value: true},
      auto_negotiation: {value: true},
      mtu: {value:1500},
      mode: {value: "access"},
      untagged_vlan: {value: 10},
      role: {value: "end_user"},
    }
  ) {
    ok
    object {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

## Retrieving profiles from Infrahub

We can query Infrahub to retrieve the interface profile using the following GraphQL query

```graphql
query {
  ProfileInfraInterface(profile_name__value: "end-user-interface") {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        profile_name {
          value
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Creating a node using a profile

We can now create multiple interfaces that will inherited the attributes we defined in our `end-user-interface` profile.

```graphql
mutation {
  int0: InfraInterfaceCreate(
    data: {name: {value: "GigabitEthernet0/0/0"}, profiles: [{id: "end-user-interface"}]}
  ) {
    ok
    object {
      id
    }
  }
  int1: InfraInterfaceCreate(
    data: {name: {value: "GigabitEthernet0/0/1"}, profiles: [{id: "end-user-interface"}]}
  ) {
    ok
    object {
      id
    }
  }
  int2: InfraInterfaceCreate(
    data: {name: {value: "GigabitEthernet0/0/2"}, profiles: [{id: "end-user-interface"}]}
  ) {
    ok
    object {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

We will now query for one of the interfaces we created and check the values of the name and status attribute and the metadata.

```graphql
query {
  InfraInterface(name__value: "GigabitEthernet0/0/0") {
    edges {
      node {
        name {
          value
          is_from_profile
        }
        status {
          value
          is_default
          is_from_profile
          source {
            id
            display_label
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

On the name attribute we can see that the `is_from_profile` property is `False`, indicating the name attribute was not inherited from a profile. The status attribute has the `is_from_profile` property set to `True` and the `source__id` property is set to the id of the profile from which the value was inherited.

The status attribute value is inherited from the profile, because we didn't specify a value for that attribute when we created the interface, hence the `is_default` property of the status attribute is `True`.

## Overriding profile attribute values

We will now create another interface `GigabitEthernet0/0/3` using the profile. But we want to override the value of the MTU attribute, which is defined in the profile. To do this we have to explicitly provide a value for the attribute.

```graphql
mutation {
  InfraInterfaceCreate(
    data: {name: {value: "GigabitEthernet0/0/3"}, mtu: {value: 9000}, profiles: [{id: "end-user-interface"}]}
  ) {
    ok
    object {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

Using this query we can verify that the value for the MTU attribute and that it was not inherited from a profile.

```query
query {
  InfraInterface(name__value: "GigabitEthernet0/0/3") {
    edges {
      node {
        mtu {
          value
          is_from_profile
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
