# Installing infrahub-sdk

The Infrahub SDK for Python is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/infrahub-sdk/) and can be installed using the pip package installer. It is recommended to install the SDK into a virtual environment.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install infrahub-sdk
```

## Installing optional extras

Extras can be installed as part of the Python SDK and are not installed by default.

The `ctl` extra provides the `infrahubctl` command, which allows you to interact with an Infrahub instance.

```

The `tests` extra provides all the components for the testing framework of Transforms, Queries and Checks.

```
