# Installing infrahub-sdk

The Infrahub SDK for Python is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/infrahub-sdk/) and can be installed using the pip package installer. It is recommended to install the SDK into a virtual environment.

```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install infrahub-sdk
```

## Installing optional extras

Extras can be installed as part of the Python SDK and are not installed by default.
