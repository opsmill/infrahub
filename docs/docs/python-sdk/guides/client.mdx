# Creating an Infrahub client

Interfacing with Infrahub through the Python SDK is performed using a client object. A client object defines the Infrahub instance that you will be interfacing with. It provides methods to query data, create data, manage the schema and branches in Infrahub.

The Python SDK supports synchronous and asynchronous Python.

## Asynchronous Python

The default client class `InfrahubClient` provides the asynchronous version.

```python
from infrahub_sdk import InfrahubClient
client = InfrahubClient(address="http://localhost:8000")
```

## Synchronous Python

The `InfrahubClientSync` class provides the synchronous version.

```python
from infrahub_sdk import InfrahubClientSync
client = InfrahubClientSync(address="http://localhost:8000")
```

## Authentication

The SDK is using a token-based authentication method to authenticate with the API and GraphQL. The token can be provided using a `Config` object or you can define it as the `INFRAHUB_API_TOKEN` environment variable.

<Tabs groupId="async-sync">
  <TabItem value="Async" default>

  ```python
  from infrahub_sdk import Config, InfrahubClient
  client = await InfrahubClient(config=Config(api_token="token"))
  client = await InfrahubClient() # token is read from the INFRAHUB_API_TOKEN environment variable
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Sync" default>

  ```python
  from infrahub_sdk import Config, InfrahubClientSync
  client = InfrahubClientSync(config=Config(api_token="token"))
  client = InfrahubClientSync() # token is read from the INFRAHUB_API_TOKEN environment variable
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Configuring the client object

The client object can be configured by providing a `Config` object. Here we will show you how to enable the client to print out all of the GraphQL queries it will send to Infrahub.

<Tabs groupId="async-sync">
  <TabItem value="Async" default>

  ```python
  from infrahub_sdk import Config, InfrahubClient
  config = Config(echo_graphql_queries=True)
  client = await InfrahubClient(config=config)
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Sync" default>

  ```python
  from infrahub_sdk import Config, InfrahubClientSync
  config = Config(echo_graphql_queries=True)
  client = InfrahubClientSync(config=config)
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

More details on the available configuration options can be found [SDK configuration reference](/python-sdk/reference/config).

## Setting the default branch

The client object can be configured to use a specific branch in Infrahub. By default the client will use the main branch, but you can change this to be any other branch. The methods, provided by the client, have a branch argument which allow you to specific against which branch you want to execute the functionality provided by the branch. If this argument is not provided then the `default_branch` of the client will be used.

  <TabItem value="Async" default>

  ```python
  from infrahub_sdk import InfrahubClient, Config
  config = Config(default_branch="other-branch")
  client_other_branch = InfrahubClient(config=config)

  tag_other_branch = await client_other_branch.get(kind="BuiltinTag", name__value="RED")
  tag_main_branch = await client_other_branch.get(kind="BuiltinTag", name__value="RED", branch="main")
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Sync" default>

  ```python
  from infrahub_sdk import InfrahubClientSync, Config
  config = Config(default_branch="other-branch")
  client_other_branch = InfrahubClientSync(config=config)

  tag_other_branch = client_other_branch.get(kind="BuiltinTag", name__value="RED")
  tag_main_branch = client_other_branch.get(kind="BuiltinTag", name__value="RED", branch="main")
  ```
