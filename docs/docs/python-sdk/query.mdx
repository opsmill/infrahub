# Query data from Infrahub

The Python SDK has 3 main methods to query data from Infrahub

- `client.get()`: Query a single object based on some filters
- `client.all()`: Query all objects of a given kind.
- `client.filters()`: Query a list of objects from a given kind based on some filters.

:::note

It's also possible to execute a GraphQL query directly with `client.execute_graphql()`

    ```python
    from infrahub_sdk import InfrahubClient

    client = await InfrahubClient.init(address="http://localhost:8000")
    accounts = await client.all(kind="CoreAccount")
    ```

    ```python
    from infrahub_sdk import InfrahubClient

    client = await InfrahubClient.init(address="http://localhost:8000")
    accounts = await client.get(kind="CoreAccount", id="XXX")
    ```

    ```python
    from infrahub_sdk import InfrahubClient

    client = await InfrahubClient.init(address="http://localhost:8000")
    accounts = await client.filters(kind="CoreAccount", name__value="admin")
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Sync">

    ```python
    from infrahub_sdk import InfrahubClientSync

    client = InfrahubClientSync.init(address="http://localhost:8000")
    accounts = client.all(kind="CoreAccount")
    ```

    ```python
    from infrahub_sdk import InfrahubClientSync

    client = InfrahubClientSync.init(address="http://localhost:8000")
    accounts = client.get(kind="CoreAccount", id="XXX")
    ```

    ```python
    from infrahub_sdk import InfrahubClientSync

    client = InfrahubClientSync.init(address="http://localhost:8000")
    accounts = client.filters(kind="CoreAccount", name__value="admin")
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

All 3 methods will return an `InfrahubNode` object or a list of `InfrahubNode` objects.
All Attributes and Relationships defined in the schema will be automatically built into the object when it's being initialized.

    ```python
    from infrahub_sdk import InfrahubClient

    client = await InfrahubClient.init(address="http://localhost:8000")
    account = await client.get(kind="CoreRepository", id="XXX")
    print(account.name.value)
    ```

  <TabItem value="Sync">

    ```python
    from infrahub_sdk import InfrahubClientSync

    client = InfrahubClientSync.init(address="http://localhost:8000")
    account = client.get(kind="CoreRepository", id="XXX")
    print(account.name.value)
    ```

## Control what will be queried

For all 3 methods you must provide the `kind` of the objects you want to query and based on the schema the SDK will automatically generate the right GraphQL query.

By default, the query will include, the attributes, the relationships of cardinality one and the relationships of kind `Attribute`.

it's possible to add or remove some attributes and/or relationships from the query with `include` and `exclude`

  <TabItem value="Async" default>

    ```python
    from infrahub_sdk import InfrahubClient

    client = await InfrahubClient.init(address="http://localhost:8000")
    accounts = await client.all(kind="CoreRepository", exclude=["tags"], include=["queries"])
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Sync">

    ```python
    from infrahub_sdk import InfrahubClientSync

    client = InfrahubClientSync.init(address="http://localhost:8000")
    accounts = client.all(kind="CoreRepository", exclude=["tags"], include=["queries"])
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Managing relationships

There are situations to consider while managing relationships via the SDK, depending if the relationship was included in the query or not.

Relationships that are included in a query will be automatically `initialized` which means the ID, type and display name of the peers will be included in the query.

In both cases, you can `fetch()` all the peers of a relationship

    client = await InfrahubClient.init(address="http://localhost:8000")
    account: InfrahubNode = await client.get(kind="CoreRepository", id="XXXX")
    await account.tags.fetch()
    tags: List[InfrahubNode]  = [ tag.peer for tag in account.tags ]
    ```
