# Welcome to Infrahub

Infrahub from [OpsMill](https://opsmill.com) is taking a new approach to Infrastructure Management by providing a new generation of datastore to organize and control all the data that defines how an infrastructure should run. Infrahub offers a central hub to manage the data, templates and playbooks that power your infrastructure by combining the version control and branch management capabilities of Git with the flexible data model and UI of a graph database.
