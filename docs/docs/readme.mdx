# Welcome to Infrahub

Infrahub is taking a new approach to Infrastructure Management by providing a new generation of datastore to organize and control all the data that defines how an infrastructure should run.

At its heart, Infrahub is built on 3 fundamental pillars:

- **Powerful Schema**: that's easily extensible
- **Unified Version Control**: for data and files
- **Data Synchronization**: with traceability and ownership

## Getting started

- Choose your Infrahub deployment method:
  - [Deploy an instance of Infrahub in the Cloud via GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub?tab=readme-ov-file#quick-start)
  - [Deploy the demo environment on your laptop](/tutorials/getting-started/#prepare-the-demo-environment)
- Explore the Python SDK to easily interact with Infrahub
- Explore the capabilities of the schema
- Check the architecture document to understand how the application is built

## Project status

The project is currently in a Tech Preview phase, which means that not all features we are targeting for the first major release have been implemented yet and the project is still evolving at a very rapid pace with the (un)stability that you would expect in an early project.

Having said that there are several features already available and you should be able already to:

- Manage branches and query any branches
- Integrate a Git repository within Infrahub
- Integrate and render Jinja2 templates
- Expose new data Transformation endpoints
- Validate data within the CI/CD pipeline
- Extend the current schema
- Query and modify data via the GraphQL interface
- Access the previous state of the data and the extensions
- Branch diff

Missing features we are actively working on.

- Object Profile and Inheritance
- Pull requests
- Branches support for the schema and schema migration
