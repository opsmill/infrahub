Fixed incorrect consumer timeout for RabbitMQ queue infrahub.rpcs

If you are upgrading from a previous version of Infrahub and using the provided Docker Compose files you don't have to take any additional action. However if you are using your own setup for RabbitMQ you will need to manually delete the queue yourself.

Swap the container name and credentials to RabbitMQ if they are different in your setup:

```bash
docker exec -it infrahub-message-queue-1 rabbitmqadmin --username infrahub --password infrahub delete queue name=infrahub.rpcs
```

After this step Infrahub and the Git agents need to be restarted, when doing so the correct queue will be recreated.
