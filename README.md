# Welcome to Infrahub

Infrahub is taking a new approach to Infrastructure Management by providing a new generation of datastore to organize and control all the data that defines how an infrastructure should run.

At its heart, Infrahub is built on 3 fundamental pillars:

- **Powerful Schema**: that's easily extensible
- **Unified Version Control**: for data and files
- **Data Synchronization**: with traceability and ownership

## Quick Start

Leveraging [Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview) from Github, it's possible to start a fresh instance of Infrahub in the Cloud in minutes. This is the recommended method to try Infrahub as it reduces the effort to setup Infrahub to a couple of clicks. Use the table below to select the right environment for you, based on the branch and the initial data you would like pre-loaded in your instance.

- The `stable` branch is for the latest release; this is the recommended version for most users.
- The `develop` branch is where the preparation of the next major release is done.
- The `Default` version does not include a schema or data pre-loaded.
- The `Demo` version includes a pre-loaded schema and a sample network dataset.

> [!NOTE]
