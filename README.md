# Infrahub

Infrahub is taking a new approach to Infrastructure Automation by providing a new generation of datastore to organize and control all the data that defines how an infrastructure should run.

At its heart, Infrahub is built on 3 fundamental pillars

- Powerful Schema, easily extensible
- Unified Version Control for Data and Files
- Data Synchronization with Traceability and Ownership

## Getting Started

The project in Github is organized around 2 main branches:

- The `stable` branch (default) for the latest release, this is the recommended version for most users
- The `develop` branch where the preparation of the next major release is done.

The documentation is available for both branches and include a complete Getting Started Guide with instructions on how to setup Infrahub and multiple Articles and Guides to help you get started.

## Start a live instance of Infrahub (in the Cloud)

Leveraging a service name [`Codespace` from Github](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview), it's possible to start a fresh instance of Infrahub in the Cloud in minutes. This is the recommmended method to try Infrahub as it reduces the effort to setup Infrahub to couple of clicks.

> The cost for running an Infrahub in Codespace is covered by OpsMill

See the table below to select the right environment for you, based on the Branch and the initial data you would like in your instance.
