# Infrahub Helm Chart

## Description

This Helm chart deploys Infrahub on Kubernetes. It provides configurable templates for various Kubernetes resources including caching, databases, and message queues, ensuring a scalable and efficient deployment of the Infrahub application.

## Chart Structure

The chart includes the following files and directories:

- `Chart.yaml`: Chart metadata file.
- `templates/`: Contains the template files for Kubernetes resources.
  - `_helpers.tpl`: Template helpers/definitions.
  - `cache.yaml`: Defines the cache (Redis) deployment, service, and PVC.
  - `infrahub-configmap.yaml`: ConfigMap for Infrahub configuration.
  - `message-queue-configmap.yaml`: ConfigMap for RabbitMQ configuration.
  - `database.yaml`: Database (Neo4j) deployment, service, and PVC.
  - `infrahub-git.yaml`: Infrahub Git service deployment and service.
  - `infrahub-server-db-init-job.yaml`: Initialization jobs for Infrahub Server.
  - `infrahub-server-ingress.yaml`: Ingress configuration for Infrahub Server.
  - `infrahub-server.yaml`: Infrahub Server deployment and service.
  - `job-viewer-role.yaml`: Defines roles and permissions.
  - `message-queue.yaml`: Message Queue (RabbitMQ) deployment and service.
- `values.yaml`: Defines configuration values for the chart.

## ConfigMap for Infrahub Configuration

The `configmap.yaml` file defines a ConfigMap that includes the `infrahub.toml` configuration file. This approach avoids the need to load the configuration from a host path, making the deployment more portable and cloud-friendly.

The ConfigMap is structured as follows:

- The `internal_address` is dynamically set based on the release name, namespace, and cluster domain.
- Database, broker, cache, and other service addresses are set dynamically, referring to the relevant services within the Kubernetes cluster.
- Ports for services like the database and cache are pulled from the `values.yaml` file, ensuring flexibility and ease of configuration changes.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.12+
- Helm 3.0+
- PV provisioner support in the underlying infrastructure (if persistence is required)

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `infrahub`:

```sh
helm install infrahub path/to/infrahub/chart
```

## Configuration

The following table lists the configurable parameters in the `values.yaml` file and their default values.

| Parameter | Description | Default |
| --------- | ----------- | ------- |
| `global.kubernetesClusterDomain` | Kubernetes cluster domain | `cluster.local`  |
| `global.imageRegistry` | Image registry for pulling images | `9r2s1098.c1.gra9.container-registry.ovh.net`  |
| `global.infrahubRepository` | Repository for Infrahub images | `opsmill/infrahub-py3.11`  |
| `global.infrahubTag` | Tag for Infrahub images | `"0.8.2-helm"`  |
| `global.imagePullPolicy` | Default image pull policy | `IfNotPresent`  |
| `cache.type` | Service type for cache | `ClusterIP`  |
| `cache.cache.image.repository` | The Redis image repository | `redis` |
| `cache.cache.image.tag` | The Redis image tag | `"7.2"` |
| `database.type` | Service type for cache | `ClusterIP`  |
| `database.database.image.repository` | The Neo4j image repository | `neo4j` |
| `database.database.image.tag` | The Neo4j image tag | `5.13-community` |
| `messageQueue.messageQueue.image.repository` | The RabbitMQ image repository | `rabbitmq` |
| `messageQueue.messageQueue.image.tag` | The RabbitMQ image tag | `3.12-management` |
| ... | ... | ... |

For more detailed configuration and additional parameters, refer to the `values.yaml` file.

## Upgrading the Chart

To upgrade the chart to a new version:

```sh
helm upgrade infrahub path/to/infrahub/chart
```

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `infrahub` deployment:

```sh
helm delete infrahub
```

## Persistence

The chart offers the ability to configure persistence for the database and other components. Check the `pvc` section in `values.yaml` for more details.

## Customization

The chart is customizable through `values.yaml`. For more complex customizations and usage scenarios, refer to the official Helm documentation.
