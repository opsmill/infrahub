# Specification Quality Checklist: Graph Traversal Documentation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-24
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- This is a documentation feature; "no implementation details" is interpreted as: the spec
  states *what documentation must exist and what it must convey*, not the exact files, MDX
  structure, or tooling commands used to author it. The Diátaxis framework and the Docusaurus
  `docs/` site are named only as scope/assumption context, consistent with the repo's own
  documentation conventions.
- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`.
