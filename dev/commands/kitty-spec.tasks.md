## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Load design documents**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:
   - **Required**: plan.md (tech stack, libraries, structure), spec.md (user stories with priorities)
   - **Optional**: data-model.md (entities), contracts/ (API endpoints), research.md (decisions), quickstart.md (test scenarios)
   - Note: Not all projects have all documents. Generate tasks based on what's available.

3. **Execute task generation workflow**:
   - Load plan.md and extract tech stack, libraries, project structure
   - Load spec.md and extract user stories with their priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.)
   - If data-model.md exists: Extract entities and map to user stories
   - If contracts/ exists: Map endpoints to user stories
   - If research.md exists: Extract decisions for setup tasks
   - Generate tasks organized by user story (see Task Generation Rules below)
   - Generate dependency graph showing user story completion order
   - Create parallel execution examples per user story
   - Validate task completeness (each user story has all needed tasks, independently testable)

4. **Generate tasks.md**: Use `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as structure, fill with:
   - Correct feature name from plan.md
   - Phase 1: Setup tasks (project initialization)
   - Phase 2: Foundational tasks (blocking prerequisites for all user stories)
   - Phase 3+: One phase per user story (in priority order from spec.md)
   - Each phase includes: story goal, independent test criteria, tests (if requested), implementation tasks
   - Final Phase: Polish & cross-cutting concerns
   - All tasks must follow the strict checklist format (see Task Generation Rules below)
   - Clear file paths for each task
   - Dependencies section showing story completion order
   - Parallel execution examples per story
   - Implementation strategy section (MVP first, incremental delivery)

5. **Work Package Decomposition** (NEW - SpecKitty-specific):

   a. Determine the current branch name (from git or FEATURE_DIR path).

   b. Create the work packages directory: `dev/spec-kitty/work-packages/<branch-name>/`

   c. Group tasks from tasks.md into work packages (max 10):
      - Each WP should be independently implementable and testable
      - Group by functional area / user story
      - Respect dependencies: WPs with blocking deps listed explicitly
      - Mark which files each WP touches (for parallel conflict detection)
      - WPs that touch different files can run in parallel
      - WPs that touch the same files must be sequential

   d. For each WP, create `dev/spec-kitty/work-packages/<branch-name>/WP##.md`:
      - Use `dev/spec-kitty/kittify/templates/workpackage-template.md` as base
      - Fill in: id, feature, acceptance_criteria, goal, tasks, implementation prompt, files, dependencies
      - Set lane to `planned`
      - Number WPs sequentially: WP01, WP02, WP03...

   e. Report WP summary:
      - Total WPs created
      - Dependency graph (which WPs can run in parallel)
      - Estimated parallelism gain (e.g., "WP01+WP02 can run in parallel, saving ~30% time")

6. **Report**: Output path to generated tasks.md and WP summary:
   - Total task count
   - Task count per user story
   - Work packages created (count and paths)
   - Parallel opportunities identified
   - Independent test criteria for each story
   - Suggested MVP scope (typically just User Story 1)
   - Format validation: Confirm ALL tasks follow the checklist format (checkbox, ID, labels, file paths)
   - Suggest running `/kitty-spec.implement` next

Context for task generation: $ARGUMENTS

The tasks.md should be immediately executable - each task must be specific enough that an LLM can complete it without additional context.

## Task Generation Rules

**CRITICAL**: Tasks MUST be organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.

**Tests are OPTIONAL**: Only generate test tasks if explicitly requested in the feature specification or if user requests TDD approach.

### Checklist Format (REQUIRED)

Every task MUST strictly follow this format:

```text
- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path
```

**Format Components**:

1. **Checkbox**: ALWAYS start with `- [ ]` (markdown checkbox)
2. **Task ID**: Sequential number (T001, T002, T003...) in execution order
3. **[P] marker**: Include ONLY if task is parallelizable (different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks)
4. **[Story] label**: REQUIRED for user story phase tasks only
   - Format: [US1], [US2], [US3], etc. (maps to user stories from spec.md)
   - Setup phase: NO story label
   - Foundational phase: NO story label
   - User Story phases: MUST have story label
   - Polish phase: NO story label
5. **Description**: Clear action with exact file path

**Examples**:

- CORRECT: `- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan`
- CORRECT: `- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication middleware in src/middleware/auth.py`
- CORRECT: `- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create User model in src/models/user.py`
- CORRECT: `- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement UserService in src/services/user_service.py`
- WRONG: `- [ ] Create User model` (missing ID and Story label)
- WRONG: `T001 [US1] Create model` (missing checkbox)
- WRONG: `- [ ] [US1] Create User model` (missing Task ID)
- WRONG: `- [ ] T001 [US1] Create model` (missing file path)

### Task Organization

1. **From User Stories (spec.md)** - PRIMARY ORGANIZATION:
   - Each user story (P1, P2, P3...) gets its own phase
   - Map all related components to their story:
     - Models needed for that story
     - Services needed for that story
     - Endpoints/UI needed for that story
     - If tests requested: Tests specific to that story
   - Mark story dependencies (most stories should be independent)

2. **From Contracts**:
   - Map each contract/endpoint -> to the user story it serves
   - If tests requested: Each contract -> contract test task [P] before implementation in that story's phase

3. **From Data Model**:
   - Map each entity to the user story(ies) that need it
   - If entity serves multiple stories: Put in earliest story or Setup phase
   - Relationships -> service layer tasks in appropriate story phase

4. **From Setup/Infrastructure**:
   - Shared infrastructure -> Setup phase (Phase 1)
   - Foundational/blocking tasks -> Foundational phase (Phase 2)
   - Story-specific setup -> within that story's phase

### Phase Structure

- **Phase 1**: Setup (project initialization)
- **Phase 2**: Foundational (blocking prerequisites - MUST complete before user stories)
- **Phase 3+**: User Stories in priority order (P1, P2, P3...)
  - Within each story: Tests (if requested) -> Models -> Services -> Endpoints -> Integration
  - Each phase should be a complete, independently testable increment
- **Final Phase**: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns
